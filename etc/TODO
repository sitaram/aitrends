consider the above topic hierarchy. I use it in an app i built to show many tabs for each topic with latest ai advances in that topic. first take a step back to look at all the topics and clusters, and feel free to move the topic between clusters, split or join or rename the clusters, any way to organize this better to be more clear and comprehensive of the field of AI and all its subparts. But don't rename the individual topics yet. Take a note of what's missing that is popular and trending and people want to learn more, or it matches their field and they want to keep up with ai developments in it, or find careers in that area. Then beef up this hierarchy to add a bunch more items to each cluster, along the lines fo what's already in the cluster at that point, but also looking for what's popular and trendng and meets the goals mentioned above. research as necessary. but then, sort each cluster by popularity so that the most interesting topics are on top of that cluster, and it gets progressively less interesting downwards. Make sure that topics are present to cover the topics underlying the rich variety of AI companies out there right now (research this too), and other companies famously using AI, especially the popular and trending ones. try to make sure whatever area Slack, Inflection, Anyscale, Roblox, VC firms using AI, Snowflake, Grammarly, Airbnb, Coinbase, etc. are covered well. Research this too as needed. Then take another pass at re-clustering and renaming clusters to make it a robust and easy and well-balanced hierarchy Output the final topic hierarchy as JSON, no need for explanations. Take your time over all this and please do a very good job. Output just the json. Thanks.

consider the topic hierarchy below. I use it in an app i built to show many tabs for each topic with latest ai advances in that topic. first take a step back to look at all the topics and clusters, and feel free to move the topic between clusters, split or join or rename the clusters, any way to organize this better to be more clear and comprehensive of the field of AI and all its subparts. But don't rename the individual topics yet. Take a note of what's missing that is popular and trending and people want to learn more, or it matches their field and they want to keep up with ai developments in it, or find careers in that area. Then beef up this hierarchy to add a bunch more items to each cluster, along the lines fo what's already in the cluster at that point, but also looking for what's popular and trendng and meets the goals mentioned above. research as necessary. but then, sort each cluster by popularity so that the most interesting topics are on top of that cluster, and it gets progressively less interesting downwards. Make sure that topics are present to cover the topics underlying the rich variety of AI companies out there right now (research this too), and other companies famously using AI, especially the popular and trending ones. try to make sure whatever area Slack, Inflection, Anyscale, Roblox, VC firms using AI, Snowflake, Grammarly, Airbnb, Coinbase, etc. are covered well. Research this too as needed. Research Slack to see what industry it fits in. Then take another pass at re-clustering and renaming clusters to make it a robust and easy and well-balanced hierarchy Output the final topic hierarchy as JSON, no need for explanations. Take your time over all this and please do a very good job. Output just the json. for newly added topics, keep their names short, like 2 or rarely 3 words. and are there more industries you can add? which ones does the company Slack represent? research this more and other trending AI-using companies to get the hot industries today. finally, try to add more topics to each cluster, and if necessary, split the very large clusters into two logical groups each. Don't rename topics I originally gave you, but shorten the ones you newly added and are about to add just now. Split out infrastructure areas from the foundational AI section and move infrastructure to the end, beefing up both suitably. And add more industries. Sort each cluster by popularity.
Slack, Inflection, Anyscale, Roblox, VC firms using AI, Snowflake, Grammarly, Airbnb, Coinbase



new: consider this topic hierarchy. I use it in an app i built to show many tabs for each topic with latest ai advances in that topic.  beef up this hierarchy to add a bunch more items to each cluster, along the lines of what's already in the cluster at that point, but also looking for what's popular and trendng and meets the goals mentioned above.  Make sure that topics are present to cover the topics underlying the rich variety of AI companies out there right now, and other companies famously using AI, especially the popular and trending ones. try to make sure whatever area Slack (the messaging app), Inflection, Anyscale, Roblox, VC firms using AI, Snowflake, Grammarly, Airbnb, Coinbase, etc. are covered well. Don't rename existing topics, but for newly added topics, keep their names short, like 2 or rarely 3 words. Then, take another pass at re-clustering the topics, splitting/joining, and renaming clusters to make it a robust and easy and well-balanced hierarchy. Aim for about 10 clusters. Beef up each cluster some more, e.g., are there more industries with trending AI applications that you can add? Output the final topic hierarchy as JSON, no need for explanations.  Output just the json.
