// produce a bullet list a dozen or so of AI subtopics, just the names and prefer short ones, no acronyms, prioritizing
// terms that are prevalent and important in today's research and discourse, sorted descending order of prevalence and
// importance, while ensuring a diverse representation of the field. avoid topics that used to be hot but are now faded,
// in other words bias towards recency of importance and trendiness of the concept. cover a good mix of topics for the
// layman as well as the expert. research as needed.
