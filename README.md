## AITrends LinkedIn post

It's hard to keep up with AI. It's a firehose, and it's broad and deep and moving too fast. Not sure what's happening in AI for Healthcare, Climate Change, or Blockchain? Feeling lost among ML concepts like GANs, GNNs, or RAG? You're not alone. Looking for jobs in innovative, recently funded AI companies in your industry? Me too! It's hard to find useful info because it seems like no one's got the whole picture down to a concise, current, and comprehensive form.

That's why I built AITrends.live. I used AI to distill 200 AI-related topics across 25 aspects each, to help us get a grip on the AI landscape. For each topic, it covers their basics, evolution, and future predictions, but also aspects like (synthetic) expert Q&As, innovative use cases, key players in their ecosystems, the funding scene, career paths, upskilling resources, technical deep dives with code samples, challenges and solutions, global perspectives, and even their ethical and regulatory debates. You can traverse this grid of 5,000 cells by row (topic) and/or column (aspect). The overview tabs are built with recursive summarization, by first distilling each aspect of the topic using custom prompts, and identifying interesting narratives that weabe across those summaries and linking back to their tabs.

Pretty much the entire project has been a co-creation with ChatGPT. In three weeks, I've had more than 2,500 messages in over 100 chat sessions (many through voice chat) to piece this together. It's been about ideation and brainstorming, product design, coding, data compilation, even picking out colors. ChatGPT helped me craft everything from the broad structure to the specifics, like the topic hierarchy, the idea of tabs, and individual tab names with high-quality prompts for each tab. It came up with a page-long prompt for recursive summarization that blew me away. I "meta-wrote" most of the code, by guiding it to structure logic and implement features, refactor, debug, and fix all the bugs. It evaluated legal concerns, drafted the disclaimer, created the logo, and came up with the domain name.

This journey reshaped my view on AI's potential, showing how "powered by AI" has shifted from being a backend technology to now rising up to every role at every level, with its contributions limited only by our creativity and imagination.

I enjoyed reading about Explainable AI and GANs, the use of AI in Journalism, Predictive Justice, Music Creation, Gaming, Carbon Footprint Analysis, and Wildlife Conservation, and recently funded AI startups in various industries. I hope you too find aitrends.live useful, and the process inspiring. Let me know what you think!
